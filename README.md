# Big Bang game
## Welcome to Project 2
This is my second website for my Code Institute Full stack developer course. I have decided to create a simple interactive game from the CI options of 'rock-paper-scissor-lizard-spock. The game is a game of chance the the idea taken from the TV series The Big Bang Theory. According the the bigbangtheory.fandom webpage, the game was originally created by sam Kass.

The game has 5 options and the player plays against the computer by selecting on of the buttons. The game will then randomly select its own option and then compare it with the player's choice. Then depending on the result it will say who wins. There is a score counter for both the user and the computer.

## Colour scheme

I decided on my colour scheme by picking a colour pallet from  [https://coolors.co/] This helped me to create a simple palatte that would be consistent throughout the site.

## Typography
To create a clean and consistent look, I selected 2 fonts from Google fonts [https://fonts.google.com/] . I picked ***add image*** and ***add image*** as I felt these were clear and easy to read. I also added a backup font of sans-serif to make sure text would be comapatible on all devices. 

## Imagery
All of my images were selected from Google. The options buttons were taken from [https://thenounproject.com/search/icons/?q=big+bang+theory]
The image to explain the rules of the game came from 
Big Bang theory wiki page [https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock]

## Wire frames
When planning out the site I used a mixture of Google slides [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I12LY1pbDdL4iooFF4uohZwREEQ4EZqE-MavgFEXpl8/edit#slide=id.g2c40bf6d4af_0_7] and Balsamiq [https://balsamiq.cloud/sbglzvl/p5fmiyn/rE072] to map out how I wanted to lay out my game. I had originally taken ideas from a YouTube tutorial of how to create the game but them onve I started to create my game, I  changed it to a simpiler format.
